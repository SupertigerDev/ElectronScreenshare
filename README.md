# ElectronScreenShare
ElectronJS P2P Screen Share


## Requirements
Have ElectronJS installed globally (`npm install -g electron`)
If you want to share your screen with a friend, you will need to open your port for 9000.

## Get Prepared
First, clone this repo: 
```
git clone https://github.com/supertiger1234/ElectronScreenshare.git
```
Then, cd into the streamer directory and install the npm packages:
```
cd Streamer
npm install
```
Finally, to start the application, run this command:
```
electron .
```
Now you can open the index.html in the viewer folder for the viewer.

## How do I use this?

The viewer needs to enter the streamers ip address which will give them an id in return. the id will be needed for the streamer to connect to each other and share the screen.
